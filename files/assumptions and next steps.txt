ASSUMPTIONS:

- Looking at the data, shifts are unique based on their start date and time. 
All shifts require 60 minutes of break and have a duration of 8.5 hours.
Therefore shifts with the same start time will be treated as the same shift type in the model.

- There need to be at least 12 hours rest between two consecutive shifts.

- Employees should receive an equal amount of shifts. 
There are 56 shifts and 13 employees. This means 4.3 shifts per employee.
The model assigns between 3 and 5 shifts for each employee (soft constraint).



NEXT STEPS:

- Implementation of a user interface to enter and modify data and parameters. 

- Implementation of a visualization, ideally in a gantt chart with the possibility of manual schedule adjustments.

- Implementation of a database to store the latest schedule.


- Optimization model
Include more detailed rules based on the answers from the rosterer (see also "questions for rosterer.txt")
Improve the constraint on allowed shift combinations by grouping the shifts smarter.

- Adjust the code to be more generic:
Let the code identify the working directory instead of hard-coding it.
Ask the user for input on data assumptions (e.g. rest time between shifts, weights in objective function).
