What are the rules to be considered when allocating shifts?

1) SKILLS 
- Can every employee cover every shift or are there any skills to be considered?

2) SHIFT TYPES 
- Are there different types of shifts? Are there any specific rules for the different shift types? 
for example: "A shift crossing midnight is considered a night shift. Employees should have a day off after a night shift."

3) REST RULES 
- What is the minimum time off between two shifts? - the current implementation assumes 12 hours
- Is there any rule about the maximum number of consecutive shifts? for example: "every employee must have a day off after 5 consecutive work days"

4) WORK LOAD BALANCING AND COSTS
- Is there any preference on how to balance workload? - the current implementation tries to assign the same number of shifts to each employee
- Are there any additional costs related to shift assignment? for example: "more than 1 shift on a weekend is considered overtime and paid more"

5) EMPLOYEE AVAILABILITY AND PREFERENCES
- Do you usually consider employee preferences for scheduling?
- Are all employees fully available or can they specify unavailabilities? How about vacation times?

6) BREAK ALLOCATION
- Should the application allocate breaks?
- How should the breaks be allocated? for example: "a break cannot be in the first 2 hours or the last 2 hours of a shift"
